Things that NEED to be implemented:
	1. Things catching on fire and being turned off
	2. Players "dying" (when waterp touches fire or firep touches water)
	3. Towers

Things it'd be nice to have:
	1. Stop walking animation when static
	2. Networking
	3. Multilayered Trees (that you can walk under)
	4. Move water player's spurt a little foward (so it's not inside them)
